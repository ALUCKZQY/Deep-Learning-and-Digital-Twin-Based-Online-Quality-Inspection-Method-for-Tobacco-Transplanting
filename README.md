# Deep-Learning-and-Digital-Twin-Based-Online-Quality-Inspection-Method-for-Tobacco-Transplanting
# Tobacco transplanting quality inspection is crucial for tobacco production, as it directly affects crop yield and quality of tobacco leaves. Accurate transplanting status detection and assessment provide essential support for replanting decisions and transplanting machine optimization. Traditional methods rely on manual inspection, which suffer from high cost, low efficiency, and unstable results. To tackle the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a Deep Learning and Digital Twin-Based Online Quality Inspection Method for Tobacco Transplanting, which consists of four core modules: Transplanting Status Detection, Multi-sensor Data Fusion, Digital Twin Visualization, and Operational Optimization Feedback. This paper proposes a lightweight improved YAN-YOLO11 algorithm capable of detecting normal, exposed-root, and buried seedlings. By fusing GNSS positioning data with visual detection results, the system estimates in-row spacing and performs status assessment for missed planting and double planting, with the results mapped in real time to a digital twin tobacco field scene to support replanting and field management. Field experiments demonstrate that, compared with YOLO11n, YAN-YOLO11 achieves improvements of 2.4% in precision, 2.5% in recall, and 5.8% in mAP@0.5:0.95, while significantly reducing model complexity. The system achieves real-time performance of approximately 30 FPS in the field, with an overall seedling detection accuracy of 95.71% and a transplanting status assessment accuracy of 93.81%, meeting practical application requirements. This study effectively enhances the digitalization, automation, and refinement of tobacco transplanting operations, and provides positive implications for the sustainable development of smart agriculture and crop management.
